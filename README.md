# Santander Customer Satisfaction Challenge 2016

The code for final predictive model which placed 64th on the private leaderboard can be found in [final_submission.R](https://github.com/analyticalmonk/santandercustomersatisfaction_kaggle/blob/master/final_submission.R) above.
Creating the xgboost model involved some basic feature engineering, mostly using the insights obtained from the Kaggle forums, and a 5-fold stratified sampling method for local cross validation.
